# Personal Website
    Website link: https://victoria-shaw-13.github.io/victoriashaw.me/
## Usage 
 Personal Website with a Home page, Bio page, Resume Page, and Art Portfolio page. 
 Home page includes photo, a interative navbar, and a tabbar when window is vertical. 
 Bio page includes information about me. 
 Resume page includes a linked pdf of my resume.
 Art Portfolio page includes an image gallery of my artwork. 

 ## limitations 
 Personal Website is fully functionally on local server but lost functionality during deployment because none of the images will load. Thus, gallery does not work properly on deployed website. I can not figure out what is causing the issue. Working local branch demonstrates code before adjustments for deployment that is fully functional.
